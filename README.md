# EDS 240 Final Project

## Exotic Wildlife Trade: Uncovering the *Felidae* Family

My data set comes from the [Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES)](https://trade.cites.org/) website.

For this project I am interested in examining the international trade of wildlife species in the *Felidae* Family! My filtered data set has approximately 93,000 records for this family globally from 1975 to present.

Citation: CITES Secretariat and UNEP-WCMC (2022). A guide to using the CITES Trade Database. Version 9. Geneva, Switzerland, and Cambridge, UK.

There is [A Guide to using the CITES Trade Database](https://trade.cites.org/cites_trade_guidelines/en-CITES_Trade_Database_Guide.pdf) which includes sufficient metadata for understanding all variables. The variables in this data set include:

-   the year range (from 1975 onwards);

-   the exporter and importer (note the database includes both States and territories);

-   the source of species/items traded (e.g. wild sourced or ranched);

-   the purpose of the transaction (e.g. commercial or for botanic gardens); the trade term (e.g. live individuals, skins, etc.);

-   the taxon (i.e. genus, species, or subspecies) of interest. Querying at higher taxonomic levels is also possible (i.e. order, class, etc.).

My Research Questions:

1.  What is the most commonly reported species from the Felidae Family in the CITES database?

2.  Which countries are the largest importers/exporters for each species within the Felidae Family?

3.  What is the most common purpose (captive breeding, hunting, circus, etc.) for Felidae transactions?

4.  How has the number of wildlife traded within the Felidae family changed over the years?
